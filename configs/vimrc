" Except when Vim is run with "-u NONE" or "-C".

" Other commands can be reverted as mentioned below.

" When started as "evim", evim.vim will already have done these settings.

" want Vim to use these default values.

" This must be first, because it changes other options as a side effect.
" Avoid side effects when it was already reset.
