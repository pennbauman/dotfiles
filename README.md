## Install Scripts
For scripts to work, clone the repository to `~/.dofiles`.

To install, clone the repository to `~/.dofiles` with:

	git clone https://github.com/pennbauman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

And run the install scripts for what you want to setup.

| Script                            | Purpose |
